# color-Challenge

it's a Game whit &lt;html , css , javaScript> only

the left square must match the right square in color.
you have 5 chances to check, if in those 5 chances the color matches, so good, there's a point for you.
we have 3 red circles in the center. If you click on the check button and each separate colors matches, the circle that belongs to that color will turn green, so you can realize that should not manipulate that
but as soon as your turns get to zero, you lose and the game starts all over again.

thats that

Of course, I have to do another method manipulation that I have not done yet. That is, I need to store and read the information on local storage
